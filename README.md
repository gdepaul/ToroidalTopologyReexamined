# ToroidalTopologyReexamined
Exploring the neural data captured in (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04268-7), which the goal of demonstrating the ability to recognize between states and the underlying topology. 

Further, we are trying to establish connections between the state currently in versus the topological information, as discussed in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10008.pdf.
